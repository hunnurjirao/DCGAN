# DCGAN
Generation of Fake images using Pytorch

It was first described by Radford et. al. in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf .Here two models are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator learns to create images that look real, while a discriminator learns to tell real images apart from fakes.
